We apply Zhang’s almost Kähler Nakai–Moishezon theorem and Li–Zhang’s comparison of $J$-symplectic cones to establish a stability result for the symplectomorphism group of a rational 4-manifold $M$ with Euler number up to 12. As a corollary, we also derive a stability result for the space of embedded symplectic balls in $M$. A noteworthy feature of our approach is that we systematically explore various spaces and groups associated to a symplectic cohomology class u rather than with a single symplectic form $\omega$. To this end, we prove a weaker version of the tamed $J$-inflation procedures of D. McDuff and O. Buse that fixes a gap in their original formulations.
