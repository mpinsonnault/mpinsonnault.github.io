Let $(M,\omega)$ be a four dimensional compact connected symplectic manifold. We prove that $(M,\omega)$ admits only finitely many inequivalent Hamiltonian effective 2-torus actions. Consequently, if $M$ is simply connected, the number of conjugacy classes of 2-tori in the symplectomorphism group $\mathrm{Sympl}(M,\omega)$ is finite. Our proof is "soft". The proof uses the fact that for symplectic blow-ups of $\mathbf{C}P^2$ the restriction of the period map to the set of exceptional homology classes is proper. In an appendix, we describe results of McDuff that give a properness result for a general compact symplectic four-manifold, using the theory of $J$-holomorphic curves.
