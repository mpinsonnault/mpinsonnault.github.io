excerpt: 'Let \\(M=(M,\omega)\\) be either the product \\(S^2\times S^2\\) or the non-trivial \\(S^2\\) bundle over \\(S^2\\) endowed with any symplectic form \\(\omega\\). Suppose a finite cyclic group \\(\mathbf{Z}_n\\) is acting effectively on \\((M,\omega)\\) through Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, that is, there is an injective homomorphism \\(\mathbf{Z}_n\hookrightarrow \mathrm{Ham}(M,\omega)\\). In this paper, we investigate the homotopy type of the group \\(\mathrm{Symp}^{\mathbf{Z}_n}(M,\omega)\\) of equivariant symplectomorphisms.'

Let \\(M=(M,\omega)\\) be either the product \\(S^2\times S^2\\) or the non-trivial \\(S^2\\) bundle over \\(S^2\\) endowed with any symplectic form \\(\omega\\). Suppose a finite cyclic group \\(\mathbf{Z}_n\\) is acting effectively on \\((M,\omega)\\) through Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, that is, there is an injective homomorphism \\(\mathbf{Z}_n\hookrightarrow \mathrm{Ham}(M,\omega)\\). In this paper, we investigate the homotopy type of the group \\(\mathrm{Symp}^{\mathbf{Z}_n}(M,\omega)\\) of equivariant symplectomorphisms. We prove that for some infinite families of \\(\mathbf{Z}_n\\) actions satisfying certain inequalities involving the order \\(n\\) and the symplectic cohomology class \\([\omega]\\), the actions extends to either one or two toric actions, and accordingly, that the centralizers are homotopically equivalent to either a finite dimensional Lie group, or to the homotopy pushout of two tori along a circle. Our results rely on \\(J\\)-holomorphic techniques, on Delzant's classification of toric actions, on Karshon's classification of Hamiltonian circle actions on 4-manifolds, and on the Chen-Wilczy≈Ñski classification of smooth \\(\mathbf{Z}_n\\)-actions on Hirzebruch surfaces.
