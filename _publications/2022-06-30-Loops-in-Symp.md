We study generators of the fundamental group of the group of symplectomorphisms $\mathrm{Symp}(\mathbf{C}P^2\sharp 5\overline{\mathbf{C}P^2},\omega)$ for some particular symplectic forms. It was observed by J. Kȩdra that there are many symplectic 4-manifolds \\((M,\omega)\\), where \\(M\\) is neither rational nor ruled, that admit no circle action and \\(\pi_1(\mathrm{Ham}(M,\omega))\\) is nontrivial. On the other hand, it follows from previous results that the fundamental group of the group \\(\mathrm{Symp}(\mathbf{C}P^2\sharp k\overline{\mathbf{C}P^2},\omega)\\), of symplectomorphisms that act trivially on homology, with \\(k\leq 4\\), is generated by circle actions on the manifold. We show that, for some particular symplectic forms \\(\omega\\), the set of all Hamiltonian circle actions generates a proper subgroup in \\(\pi_1(\mathrm{Symp}(\mathbf{C}P^2\sharp 5\overline{\mathbf{C}P^2},\omega))\\). Our work depends on Delzant classification of toric symplectic manifolds, Karshon's classification of Hamiltonian \\(S^1\\)-spaces and the computation of Seidel elements of some circle actions.
