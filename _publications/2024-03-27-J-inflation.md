We give a complete and self-contained exposition of the \\(J\\)-tame inflation lemma: Given any tame almost complex structure \\(J\\) on a symplectic 4-manifold \\((M,\omega)\\), and given any compact, embedded, \\(J\\)-holomorphic submanifold \\(Z\\), it is always possible to construct a deformation of symplectic forms \\(\omega_t\\) in classes \\([\omega_t]=[\omega]+tPD(Z)\\), for \\(0\leq t\\) less than an upper bound \\(0<T\\) that only depends on the self-intersection \\(Z\cdot Z\\). The original proofs of this fact make the unwarranted assumption that one can find a family of normal planes along \\(Z\\) that is both \\(J\\) invariant and \\(\omega\\)-orthogonal to \\(TZ\\) -- which amounts, in effect, to assuming the compatibility of \\(J\\) and \\(\omega\\) along \\(Z\\). We explain how the original constructions can be adapted to avoid this assumption when \\(Z\\) has nonpositive self-intersection, and we discuss the difficulties with this line of argument in general to establish the full inflation when \\(Z\\) has positive self-intersection. We overcome this problem by proving a `preparation lemma', which states that prior to inflation, one can isotop \\(\omega\\) within its cohomology class to a new form that still tames \\(J\\) and which is compatible with \\(J\\) along the submanifold \\(Z\\).
