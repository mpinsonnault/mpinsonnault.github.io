I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics at [The University of Western Ontario in London](https://www.uwo.ca), Ontario. The [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.uwo.ca) is part of the [School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences](http://uwo.ca/smss).

Research Interests
======
My main research interests are in the field of symplectic topology and geometry, which is a branch of mathematics concerned with the study of symplectic manifolds i.e. geometric structures that arise naturally in the study of classical and quantum mechanics. Please visit my [research page](/research/) for more details.

Current Teaching
======
In the Fall 2024 term, I will be teaching the graduate course [MATH 9601A - Symplectic Geometry](/teaching/), and first year calculus CALC 1000A section 008.
