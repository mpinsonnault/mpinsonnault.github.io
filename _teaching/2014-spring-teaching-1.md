#MATH 9601A - Symplectic Geometry - Fall 2024
**Early Announcement**


**Instructor:** Martin Pinsonnault
**Office:** MC 132
**E-mail:** mpinson@uwo.ca

**Tentative Schedule:** Tuesdays and Thursdays, 11:30 to 13:00. Location TBD. Note that this schedule may be modified in consultation with all interested students.

**Course website:** The MATH 9601A OWL website will be available later in August.

**Course Outline:** The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to symplectic geometry with a view to some recent results. We will cover the foundations: symplectic and complex vector spaces, linear symplectic geometry, symplectic manifolds, key examples and problems, connections to classical mechanics, normal forms, connections to complex geometry and contact geometry, symplectic transformations, Hamiltonian actions and moment maps, symplectic reduction, classical invariants, brief introduction to $J$-holomorphic curves and the Nonsqueezing theorem.

This course should prepare students for more advanced topics like classifications of Hamiltonian actions, full-fledged $J$-holomorphic curves theory, Gromov invariants, quantum homology, Floer theory, or Mirror Symmetry. 

**What is symplectic geometry ?** At the linear level, an inner product $g$ on a real vector space $V$ is a non-degenerate *symmetric* bilinear pairing that defines an isomorphism between $V$ and its dual $V^\*$. This structure induces a geometry based on the usual notions of lengths and angles. A symplectic structure $\omega$ is a non-degenerate *skew-symmetric* bilinear pairing that defines an isomorphism between $V$ and  $V^*$. It induces a geometry based on *2-dimensional signed areas*. Over the complex numbers this structure is just as natural as an inner product since any hermitian product $h$ on a *complex* vector space $W$ is made of an inner product $g$ (the real part) and a symplectic form $\omega$ (the imaginary part).

At the non-linear level, symplectic structures on manifolds appear naturally when one wants to write the equations of classical mechanics on arbitrary curved spaces using the minimal action principle (the symplectic form measures the action) as a guideline. Less well known is the fact that symplectic structures also appear in quantum mechanics (together with inner products and complex structures) as the space of states of a quantum system is the projective space of a Hilbert space.

**Prerequisites:** Familiarity with differential geometry (in particular, differential forms and vector fields on manifolds as covered in Math 9055A/4155A - Calculus on Manifolds) and with algebraic topology (in particular, de Rham cohomology as covered in Math 9052B/4152B  - Algebraic Topology) will be assumed. Note that we will emphasize the geometrical aspects of the theory.  In particular, we will try to stay away from purely topological questions and we will minimize the use of algebraic topology machinery.

**References:** I will mostly follow the textbook

- A. Cannas da Silva, ``Lectures on Symplectic Geometry'', Lecture Notes in Mathematics, vol. 1764, Springer. 

which is freely available at

or through the UWO Library online textbook program. An errata may be consulted at

We will also draw from other well-known references as listed below. In orther to develop a deeper understanding of the subject matters, we encourage students to use more than one reference. When using online references, students must keep in mind that they may contain typos and other inaccuracies.

**Prerequisite:** Familiarity with differential geometry (in particular, differential forms and vector fields on manifolds as covered in Math 9055A/4155A - Calculus on Manifolds) and with algebraic topology (in particular, de Rham cohomology as covered in Math 9052B/4152B  - Algebraic Topology) will be assumed. 

**Tentative Evaluation Scheme:** The evaluation will consist in

- 6 short homeworks (every other week): $\sim$ 30%
- Final exam: $\sim$ 40%
- Presentation: $\sim$ 15%
- Written report: $\sim$ 15%.

The homeworks are an integral part of the course and special attention must be paid to the presentation. They will be evaluated based on both correctness and clarity. Students are allowed to discuss assignment problems, but each student should write their solutions individually, with proper credit given to those who helped you and to any references used.

At the end of the semester, each student will give a presentation ( $\sim$ 50 minutes) on a subject related to the course material. The topic should be selected as early as possible. We will maintain a list of possible topics that students can choose from. Alternatively, students may decide on another topic of particular interest/relevance for them after discussion with the intructor.
